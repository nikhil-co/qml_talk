# QSVM Introduction for the ICFO QML workshop
*24. October 2019*

This jupyter notebook gives a brief repetition of classical Support Vector Machines (SVM) and an introduction into quantum feature maps, quantum kernels and QSVM. The QSVM is implemented with QISKIT.

To run it directly we also provide a [google collab file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBEtVF-iS23sEmZwH3VEU3t_DwpQOpOq/view?usp=sharing).

This file has been produced in collaboration with Alex Dauphin.

We also thank Gorka Munoz for his help.
